    % statement
    \begin{definition}
        A professional attribute, competency, or skill, of a person $k$ can be conceptualized as a cummulative sum of successes on
        binary outcome variables representing tasks of progressive difficulty which require only that skill:
        \begin{gather}
            a_{i}^{k} = \sum_{l=0}^{l_i}
            T_{i_{l}}^{k}
            ,
        \end{gather}
        where
        \begin{gather}
            T_{i_{l}}^{k} =
            \begin{cases}
                1, \ \text{if $k$ succedes in a task $T_{i}^{l}$ of difficulty level $l$;} \\
                0, \ \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
        \end{gather}
        
        Or, more rigorously,
        \begin{gather}
            a_{i}^{k} = \sum_{l=0}^{l_i}
            T(l, l_{i}^{k})
            ,
        \end{gather}
        where
        \begin{gather}
            T(l, l_{i}^{k}) =
            T_{i_{l}}^{k} =
            \begin{cases}
                1, \ l \leq l_{i}^{k}; \\
                0, \ \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
        \end{gather}
        and $l_{i}^{k} \in [0, l_i]$ is the maximum difficulty level on which $k$ still succeedes. Thus, we can define a person $k$'s skill level in an attribute $i$ as the sum
        of their $T_{i_l}^{k}$ successful trials on a $T_{i} = \{T_{i}^{0}, \dots, T_{i}^{l_i}\}$ set of tasks of increasing
        difficulty.

        Furthermore, as we assume scales are truncated (i.e. there is a maximum
        difficulty level $l_i$, and a trivial difficulty level, which has to be zero),
        we can also interpret $a_{i}^{k}$ as the \textit{portion} of tasks one is able
        to accomplish out of all difficulty levels for that skill. By normalizing $l_i$
        to $100$, for example, we have:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 0 \iff k$ cannot perform even the most basic of attribute $i$'s tasks;
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 10 \iff k$ can perform only the bottom 10\% of attribute $i$'s tasks, but nothing more;
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 50 \iff k$ can perform the easiest half of attribute $i$'s tasks, but not the most difficult half;
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 100 \iff k$ can perform all of attribute $i$'s tasks.
        \end{enumerate}

        Finally, we can define $a_{i}^{k}$ for a continuum of task difficulty $l \in [0,1]$:
        \begin{gather}
            a_{i}^{k} =
            \int_{0}^{1}{
            T(l, l_{i}^{k})
            dl
            }
            ,
        \end{gather}
        where $T(l, l_{i}^{k})$ is defined as before.
    \end{definition}

\newcommand{\SklDifficulty}{
    \label{skl_difficulty}

    % statement
    \begin{definition}
        Alternatively, we can think of a person $k$'s professional attribute, competency, or skill, as the difficulty of the most difficult task they can accomplish, normalized by the most objectively difficult task of that particular skill:
        \begin{gather}
            a_{i}^{k} =
            \frac{
                l_{i}^{k}
            }{
                l_{i}
            }
            ,
        \end{gather}
        which we normalize by setting $l_{i} = 1$, so that
        \begin{gather}
            a_{i}^{k} =
            \frac{
                l_{i}^{k}
            }{
                1
            }
            =
            l_{i}^{k}
            ,
        \end{gather}
        and $l_{i}^{k} \in [0,1]$. With this normalization, example interpretations of $a_{i}^{k}$ are:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 0 \iff k$ cannot perform even the most basic of attribute $i$'s tasks;
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 0.10 \iff k$ can only perform tasks of up to 10\% the difficulty of attribute $i$'s most difficult task, but nothing more;
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 0.50 \iff k$ can perform tasks of up to half the difficulty of attribute $i$'s most difficult task, but nothing more;
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 1 \iff k$ can perform all of attribute $i$'s tasks.
        \end{enumerate}

        This is, perhaps, the most natural conceptual model for understanding
        competencies, as, generally, it is more intuitive to think of skill as the
        maximum of one's capacity, rather than the portion of tasks one could
        potentially accomplish.

        But, again, because we assume scales to be truncated, this latter interpretation
        actually implies and is implied by the former. For if a task is of the same
        difficulty as another, then they are just as difficult in relation to that
        skill's most difficult task (i.e. they require the same percentage of the
        scale's upper limit to be performed), and, likewise, are also included in the
        same difficulty ``bracket" (i.e. they are equivalent to the same skill test in
        the aggregate binary outcome interpretation), and, therefore, pressupose the
        same $a_{i}^{k}$ skill level.

        Of course, this equivalence is quite trivial, given that
        \begin{gather}
            \int_{0}^{1}{
            T(l, l_{i}^{k})
            dl
            }
            =
            1 \times \int_{0}^{l_{i}^{k}}{dl} +
            0 \times \int_{l_{i}^{k}}^{1}{dl}
            =
            l_{i}^{k} - 0
            =
            \frac{l_{i}^{k}}{1}
            =
            a_{i}^{k}
            .
        \end{gather}

        This means the percentage of a skill's tasks one can accomplish is also
        the difficulty of the most difficult task one can accomplish relative to that
        skill's most difficult task.

        So, however one decides to interpret skill levels, the conclusion remains the
        same: to be skilled in an attribute is to be able to perform the activities
        associated with that attribute. Put simply, the capacity to act follows virtue,
        for virtue is, itself, the capacity to act.
    \end{definition}

% region: skill sufficiency lemma (ssl) 
% skills are sufficient to accomplish tasks
\newcommand{\SSL}{
    \label{ssl}

    % preamble
    Now, even though these results are tautological, they are important to guide
    our intuition. In fact, our first insight towards the Employability Theorem
    follows directly from the definitions above:
    % statement
    \begin{lemma}[Skill Sufficiency Lemma]
        Skills are necessary and sufficient to accomplish tasks.
        In particular, to have a skill level of $a_{i}^{k}$ in attribute $i$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for one to be capable of accomplishing $a_{i}^{k}$ percent of that attribute's tasks.
    \end{lemma}

    % proof
    \begin{proof}
        By definition,
        \begin{gather*}
            T(l, l_{i}^{k}) =
            \begin{cases}
                1, \ l \leq l_{i}^{k}; \\
                0, \ \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
        \end{gather*}
        is a binary indicator of person $k$'s ability to accomplish a task of difficulty $l \in [0,1]$ which requires only attribute $i$.
        
        With this,
        \begin{gather*}
            \tilde{T}_{i}^{k}
            =
            \int_{0}^{1}{
            T(l, l_{i}^{k})
            dl
            }
        \end{gather*}
        is the percentage of tasks requiring only attribute $i$, that $k$ can accomplish.

        But both equivalent definitions of $k$'s skill level in attribute $i$, are
        \begin{gather*}
            a_{i}^{k} = 
            \int_{0}^{1}{
            T(l, l_{i}^{k})
            dl
            }
            =
            l_{i}^{k}
            ,
        \end{gather*}
        which is precisely the $\tilde{T}_{i}^{k}$ aggregation of $T(l, l_{i}^{k})$ in the $[0,1]$ interval.

        Therefore, having a skill level of $a_{i}^{k}$ is a necessary and sufficient condition to be capable of accomplishing $a_{i}^{k}$ percent of attribute $i$'s tasks:
        \begin{gather*}
            a_{i}^{k} =
            \tilde{T}_{i}^{k}
            \iff
            \int_{0}^{1}{
            T(l, l_{i}^{k})
            dl
            } =
            \int_{0}^{1}{
            T(l, l_{i}^{k})
            dl
            }
            .
        \end{gather*}
    \end{proof}
