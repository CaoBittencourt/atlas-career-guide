    % statement
    \begin{definition}[Skill]
        A professional attribute, competency, or skill, of a person $k$ can be conceptualized as a cummulative sum of successes on
        binary outcome variables representing tasks of progressive difficulty which require only that skill:
        \begin{gather}
            a_{i}^{k} = \sum_{l=0}^{l_i}
            T_{i_{l}}^{k}
            ,
        \end{gather}
        where
        \begin{gather}
            T_{i_{l}}^{k} =
            \begin{cases}
                1, \ \text{if $k$ succedes in a task $T_{i}^{l}$ of difficulty level $l$;} \\
                0, \ \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
        \end{gather}
        
        Or, more rigorously,
        \begin{gather}
            a_{i}^{k} = \sum_{l=0}^{l_i}
            T(l, l_{i}^{k})
            ,
        \end{gather}
        where
        \begin{gather}
            T(l, l_{i}^{k}) =
            T_{i_{l}}^{k} =
            \begin{cases}
                1, \ l \leq l_{i}^{k}; \\
                0, \ \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
        \end{gather}
        and $l_{i}^{k} \in [0, l_i]$ is the maximum difficulty level on which $k$ still succeedes. Thus, we can define a person $k$'s skill level in an attribute $i$ as the sum
        of their successful trials on a $T_{i} = \{T_{i}^{0}, \dots, T_{i}^{l_i}\}$ set of tasks of increasing
        difficulty.

        Furthermore, as we assume scales are truncated (i.e. there is a maximum
        difficulty level $l_i$, and a trivial difficulty level, which has to be zero),
        we can also interpret $a_{i}^{k}$ as the \textit{portion} of tasks one is able
        to accomplish out of all difficulty levels for that skill. By normalizing $l_i$
        to $100$, for example, we have:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 0 \iff k$ cannot perform even the most basic of attribute $i$'s tasks;
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 10 \iff k$ can perform only the bottom 10\% of attribute $i$'s tasks, but nothing more;
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 50 \iff k$ can perform the easiest half of attribute $i$'s tasks, but not the most difficult half;
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 100 \iff k$ can perform all of attribute $i$'s tasks.
        \end{enumerate}

        Finally, we can define $a_{i}^{k}$ for a continuum of task difficulty $l \in [0,1]$:
        \begin{gather}
            a_{i}^{k} =
            \int_{0}^{1}{
            T(l, l_{i}^{k})
            dl
            }
            ,
        \end{gather}
        where $T(l, l_{i}^{k})$ is defined as before.
    \end{definition}

    \label{skl_difficulty}

    % statement
    \begin{definition}[Skill]
        Alternatively, we can think of a person $k$'s professional attribute, competency, or skill, as the difficulty of the most difficult task they can accomplish, normalized by the difficulty of the most objectively difficult task of that particular skill:
        \begin{gather}
            a_{i}^{k} =
            \frac{
                l_{i}^{k}
            }{
                l_{i}
            }
            ,
        \end{gather}
        which we normalize by setting $l_{i} = 1$, so that
        \begin{gather}
            a_{i}^{k} =
            \frac{
                l_{i}^{k}
            }{
                1
            }
            =
            l_{i}^{k}
            ,
        \end{gather}
        and $l_{i}^{k} \in [0,1]$. With this normalization, example interpretations of $a_{i}^{k}$ are:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 0 \iff k$ cannot perform even the most basic of attribute $i$'s tasks;
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 0.10 \iff k$ can only perform tasks of up to 10\% the difficulty of attribute $i$'s most difficult task, but nothing more;
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 0.50 \iff k$ can perform tasks of up to half the difficulty of attribute $i$'s most difficult task, but nothing more;
            \item $a_{i}^{k} = 1 \iff k$ can perform all of attribute $i$'s tasks.
        \end{enumerate}

        This is, perhaps, the most natural conceptual model for understanding
        competencies, as, generally, it is more intuitive to think of skill as the
        maximum of one's capacity, rather than the portion of tasks one could
        potentially accomplish.

        But, again, [because we assume scales to be truncated], this latter interpretation
        actually implies and is implied by the former. For if a task is of the same
        difficulty as another, then they are just as difficult in relation to that
        skill's most difficult task (i.e. they require the same percentage of the
        scale's upper limit to be performed), and, likewise, are also included in the
        same difficulty ``bracket" (i.e. they are equivalent to the same skill test in
        the aggregate binary outcome interpretation), and, therefore, pressupose the
        same $a_{i}^{k}$ skill level.

        Of course, this equivalence is quite trivial, given that
        \begin{gather}
            \int_{0}^{1}{
            T(l, l_{i}^{k})
            dl
            }
            =
            1 \times \int_{0}^{l_{i}^{k}}{dl} +
            0 \times \int_{l_{i}^{k}}^{1}{dl}
            =
            l_{i}^{k} - 0
            =
            \frac{l_{i}^{k}}{1}
            =
            a_{i}^{k}
            .
        \end{gather}

        This means the percentage of a skill's tasks one can accomplish is also
        the difficulty of the most difficult task one can accomplish relative to that
        skill's most difficult task.

        So, however one decides to interpret skill levels, the conclusion remains the
        same: to be skilled in an attribute is to be able to perform the activities
        associated with that attribute. Put simply, the capacity to act follows virtue,
        for virtue is, itself, the capacity to act.
    \end{definition}

    \label{ssl}

    % preamble
    Now, even though these results are basically tautological, they are still important to guide our intuition. In fact, our first insight towards the Employability Theorem, namely the Skill Sufficiency Lemma (SSL), follows directly from the definitions above.
    % statement
    \begin{lemma}[Skill Sufficiency Lemma]
        According to the SSL, skills are necessary and sufficient to accomplish tasks.
        In particular, to have a skill level of $a_{i}^{k} \in [0,1]$ in attribute $i$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for one to be capable of accomplishing the easier $a_{i}^{k}$ portion of that attribute's tasks.
    \end{lemma}

    % proof
    \begin{proof}
        By definition,
        \begin{gather}
            T(l, l_{i}^{k}) =
            \begin{cases}
                1, \ l \leq l_{i}^{k}; \\
                0, \ \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
        \end{gather}
        is a binary indicator of person $k$'s ability to accomplish a task of difficulty $l \in [0,1]$ which requires only attribute $i$.
        
        With this,
        \begin{gather}
            \tilde{T}_{i}^{k}
            =
            \int_{0}^{1}{
            T(l, l_{i}^{k})
            dl
            }
        \end{gather}
        is the percentage of tasks requiring only attribute $i$ that $k$ can accomplish.

        But both equivalent definitions of $k$'s skill level in attribute $i$, are
        \begin{gather}
            a_{i}^{k} = 
            \int_{0}^{1}{
            T(l, l_{i}^{k})
            dl
            }
            =
            l_{i}^{k}
            ,
        \end{gather}
        which is precisely the $\tilde{T}_{i}^{k}$ aggregation of $T(l, l_{i}^{k})$ in the $[0,1]$ interval.

        Therefore, having a skill level of $a_{i}^{k}$ is a necessary and sufficient condition to be capable of accomplishing the easier $a_{i}^{k}$ portion of attribute $i$'s tasks:
        \begin{gather}
            a_{i}^{k} =
            \tilde{T}_{i}^{k}
            \iff
            \int_{0}^{1}{
            T(l, l_{i}^{k})
            dl
            } =
            \int_{0}^{1}{
            T(l, l_{i}^{k})
            dl
            }
            .

\newcommand{\ComplexTask}{
    \label{complex_task}

    % statement
    \begin{definition}[Complex Task]
        A task is said to be complex if it relies on more than one attribute to be accomplished. More precisely, $T_{ij}^{l}$ is a complex task of attributes $i$ and $j$, if its binary outcome indicator is of the form
        \begin{gather}
            T(l, l_{ij}^{k}) =
            \begin{cases}
                1, \ l \leq l_{ij}^{k}; \\
                0, \ \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
        \end{gather}
        where
        \begin{gather}
            l_{ij}^{k} = f(l_{i}^{k}, l_{j}^{k})
        \end{gather}
        is a strictly increasing aggregation function that returns the maximum difficulty level of the complex task $T_{ij}^{l}$ a person $k$ can accomplish based on each attribute $T_{ij}^{l}$ requires. Or, generalizing for any complex task $T_{q}^{l}$ of $m$ attributes, requiring an entire skill set $\boldsymbol{a_q} = (a_{1}^{q}, \dots, a_{m}^{q})$ to be accomplished, 
        \begin{gather}
            T(l, l_{q}^{k}) =
            \begin{cases}
                1, \ l \leq l_{q}^{k}; \\
                0, \ \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
        \end{gather}
        where
        \begin{gather}
            l_{q}^{k} = 
            f(\boldsymbol{l_{q}^{k}}) =
            f(l_{1}^{k}, \dots, l_{m}^{k})
        \end{gather}
        and 
        \begin{gather}
            \frac{
                \partial
                f(\boldsymbol{l_{q}^{k}})
            }{
                \partial 
                l_{i}^{k}
            } > 0
            \
            \forall 
            \
            i \in \{1, \dots, m\}
            .
        \end{gather}
            
        This means none of the attributes required by the complex task are completely disposable (i.e. they are all helpful in some way). For instance, the task $T_{i}^{l}$, previously defined, with binary outcome $T(l, l_{i}^{k})$ is not complex, because
        \begin{gather}
            \frac{
                \partial
                l_{i}^{k}
            }{
                \partial 
                l_{i}^{k}
            } = 1
            ,
        \end{gather}
        but
        \begin{gather}
            \frac{
                \partial
                l_{i}^{k}
            }{
                \partial 
                l_{j}^{k}
            } = 0
            , 
        \end{gather}
        where $i \neq j$ and $i, j \in \{1, \dots, m\}$. Or, say the aggregation function is given by
        \begin{gather}
            f(l_{i}^{k}, l_{j}^{k}) = 
            l_{i}^{k} - l_{j}^{k}
            ,
        \end{gather}
        so that attribute $j$ actually hinders productivity:
        \begin{gather}
            \frac{
                \partial
                l_{i}^{k}
            }{
                \partial 
                l_{j}^{k}
            } = -1
            .
        \end{gather}
            
        None of these are complex tasks, for they do not coherently mobilize multiple attributes towards a unified goal.
        
        \begin{subdefinition}[Weak Complexity]
            Now, besides this most basic rule, we can define stricter versions of ``task complexity'' with additional assumptions. The first version, of weak complexity, requires:
            \begin{gather}
                \frac{
                    \partial ^ 2 {f(\boldsymbol{l_{q}^{k}})}
                }{
                    \partial 
                    l_{i}^{k}
                    \partial
                    l_{j}^{k}
                }
                \geq 0
                \
                \forall
                \
                i, j \in \{1, \dots, m\}
                ,
                i \neq j
                ,
            \end{gather}
            meaning attributes are complementary.
        \end{subdefinition}
        
        \begin{subdefinition}[Moderate Complexity]
            A task is of moderate complexity if its aggregation function also meets the following criteria:
            \begin{gather}
                \lim_{
                    l_{i}^{k} \rightarrow 0
                }{
                    f(\boldsymbol{l_{q}^{k}})
                } = 0
                \
                \forall 
                \
                i \in \{1, \dots, m\}
                .
            \end{gather}
        \end{subdefinition}
        
        \begin{subdefinition}[Strong Complexity]
            The strictest definition of task complexity adds the constraint that attributes are aggregated by the Leontiev function:
            \begin{gather}
                f(\boldsymbol{l_{q}^{k}}) = 
                \min(\boldsymbol{l_{q}^{k}})
                .
            \end{gather}

        \end{subdefinition}

        Thus, a person $k$'s capacity to perform a complex task is weakly increasing on their capacity to perform the simple tasks of its required attributes, and goes to zero when they are unskilled in at least one of these attributes.

        This means a task is only strictly \textit{complex} if it cannot be reduced to any proper subset of the attributes that it requires. For example, a task of the form
        \begin{gather}
            T(l, l_{ij}^{k}) =
            \begin{cases}
                1, \ l \leq l_{i}^{k} + l_{j}^{k}; \\
                0, \ \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
        \end{gather}
        is not, strictly speaking, a complex task, because if person $k$ is only skilled in either attribute $i$ or $j$, they can still accomplish the task. In particular, if $k$ has precisely zero capacity in either attribute, then $T_{ij}^{l}$ collapses to unidimensional, or simple, tasks $T_{i}^{l}$ when
        \begin{gather}
            T(l, l_{ij}^{k}) =
            \begin{cases}
                1, \ l \leq l_{i}^{k} + 0; \\
                0, \ \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
            = T(l, l_{i}^{k})
            ,\\
        \end{gather}
        or $T_{j}^{l}$ when
        \begin{gather}
            T(l, l_{ij}^{k}) =
            \begin{cases}
                1, \ l \leq 0 + l_{j}^{k}; \\
                0, \ \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
            = T(l, l_{j}^{k})
            ,
        \end{gather}
        in which case $T_{ij}^{l}$ is not \textit{really} complex, but rather a convolution of simple tasks. Notice this has nothing to do with whether $l_{ij}^{k} \in [0,1]$. In fact, if $l_{ij}^{k}$ is given by, say, $l_{ij}^{k} = \sigma_{i} l_{i}^{k} + (1 - \sigma_{i})l_{j}^{k}$, with $\sigma_{i}, l_{i}^{k}, l_{j}^{k} \in [0,1]$, and $k$ has zero capacity in either attribute,
        \begin{gather}
            T(l, l_{ij}^{k}) =
            \begin{cases}
                1, \ l \leq \sigma_{i} l_{i}^{k} + 0; \\
                0, \ \text{otherwise.}
            \end{cases}
            = T(l, \sigma_{i} l_{i}^{k})
        \end{gather}
        and 
        \begin{gather}

            \begin{cases}
                1, \ l \leq 0 + (1 - \sigma_{i}) l_{j}^{k}; \\
                0, \ \text{otherwise.}

        are still simple, not complex tasks, even if they are ``harder versions'' of $T_{i}^{l}$ and $T_{j}^{l}$, respectively, as the maximum difficulty level $k$ can accomplish of task $T_{ij}^{l}$ is only limited by both attributes, not necessarily determined by them -- hence why this formulation is better thought of as two separate tasks.
        
        Of course, this does not mean a degree of substitution between attributes completely invalidates a task's complexity. It only means a complex task must require all of its attributes at \textit{some} level, even if its functional form allows for substitution. However, if it does not require all of its attributes, then it should be broken down into other simple and/or complex tasks. In Economic terms, this is equivalent to saying that competencies, when used to perform complex tasks, are at least weakly complementary.

    \label{scl}

    % statement
    \begin{lemma}[Skill Composition Lemma]
        The Skill Composition Lemma (SCL) is a generalization of the SSL and states that skills are composable to accomplish complex tasks. More precisely, let $T_{q}^{l}$ be an activity of difficulty level $l$ that requires the $\boldsymbol{a_q} = (a_{1}^{q}, \dots, a_{m}^{q})$ skill set (i.e. $T_{q}^{l}$ is a complex task). With this, we demonstrate that any rational and sufficiently qualified economic agent can naturally ``piece together'', that is \textit{compose}, attributes $\{1, \dots, m\}$ to accomplish the $T_{q}^{l}$ complex task.
