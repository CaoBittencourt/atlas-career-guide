% skill sufficiency axiom (ssa)
% skills are sufficient to accomplish tasks
\newtheorem{axiom}{Skill Sufficiency Axiom}

% skill composition axiom (sca)
% skills are composable to accomplish complex tasks
\newtheorem{axiom}{Skill Composition Axiom}

% occupational reducibility axiom (ora)
% occupations can be reduced to their tasks
\newtheorem{axiom}{Occupational Reducibility Axiom}

% occupational complexity axiom (oca)
% all of an occupation's tasks can be thought of as only
% one, indivisible, holistic task, requiring their entire skill set
% we call this an occupation's "operation"
% all an occupation does is its "operation"
% define an aggregation function to compose skills an an "operation"
% operation production: evaluated aggregation function
% max production: occupation's evaluated aggregation function
% productivity: production truncated and normalized by max production
\newtheorem{axiom}{Occupational Complexity Axiom}

% occupational composition corollary (occ)
% sca, ora, oca => occ
% skill sets are composable to accomplish occupations' "operations"
\newtheorem{corollary}{Occupational Composition Corollary}

% occupational divisibility remark 1 (odr 1) on occ
% one can only accomplish the part of an occupation's operation
% that one is sufficiently qualified for
% one can accomplish parts of an operation even if productivity < 1

% occupational divisibility remark 2 (odr 2) on occ
% if one cannot accomplish parts of an occupation's operation,
% then these harder levels of the operation can be outsourced
% though a holistic operation is not divisible, difficulty levels are

% rationality axiom (ra)
% employers are rational
% employers will only pay for employees to work on tasks they can accomplish
% if required, employers will outsource parts of an occupation's operation
\newtheorem{axiom}{Rationality Axiom}

% hireability axiom (ha)
% hiring is done by evaluating a hireability statistic
\newtheorem{axiom}{Hireability Axiom}

% occupational essence corollary (oec)
% all of an occupation's job posts are essentially the same
% because all job posts require sufficient similarity,
% and because employers will not hire anyone who is not hireable,
% in accordance with the hireability statistic,
% therefore, all of an occupation's job posts, despite their accidents,
% are sufficiently recognized as a true instance of that occupation
\newtheorem{axiom}{Occupational Essence Corollary}

% labor market completeness axiom (lmca)
% there is sufficient talent in the labor market to outsource difficult tasks
% this is tautological, because the labor market is already producing its current output
\newtheorem{axiom}{Labor Market Completeness Axiom}

% task duration axiom (tda)
% define a time to completion function: task difficulty => task duration
\newtheorem{axiom}{Task Duration Axiom}

% potential employability theorem (pet)
% the potential employability of a person in a particular occupation
% is the percentage of that occupation's operation total time duration
% that their skill set allows them to accomplish
\newtheorem{theorem}{Potential Employability Theorem}
