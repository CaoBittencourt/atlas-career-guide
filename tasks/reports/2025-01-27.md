# Weekly Summary (2025-01-27)
- fully-vectorized `match/vec` (matching module)
- fixed a bug in GMME matching (turns out Cobb-Douglas != GMME afterall)
- new modules
    - `prod`: productivity module
    - `labor`: labor-economic models module
        - `employability` submodule
            - `employability` proper
            - `competitiveness`
            - `vulnerability`
            - `misc`
- fixed bugs in `micro/kflex` and vectorized skill set versatility function (previous version was not fully vectorized)
    - `kflex/macroflex`
    - `kflex/microflex`
- tested everything
- mathematical basis for job-satisfaction coefficient
- current tasks:
    - job-satisfaction coefficient (`compare/joy`)
    - new competence coefficient (`describe/comp`)
    - considering switching to julia
        - advantages:
            - as fast as C
            - (optional) type system
            - procedural / functional, not oop
                - has support for structs / subtyping and functional polymorphism
                - but does not support object-(dis)orientation
            - also, has a pipe operator just like R
            - made for stats and scientific computing
                - has several packages for doing math like R
            - good support for vectorized operations
        - disadvantages:
            - relatively new language
            - smaller community
            - have to rewrite existing modules to `.jl`
                - workaround: use `RCall` to call R from julia
                - additionally / alternatively, use `JuliaCall` to call julia from R
        - suggested course of action:
            - write next module in both languages
            - test `JuliaCall` and `RCall`
            - benchmark speed
