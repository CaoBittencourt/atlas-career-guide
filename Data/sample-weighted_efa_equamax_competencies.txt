sample-weighted efa: equamax rotation with competencies only (120 items)

Use no less than 13 factors (Kaiser criterion), otherwise:
1) Insufficiently differentiated factors
2) Odd groups (including e.g. medicine + philosophy)
P.S.: Use no more than 16 factors due to factor granularity.

factor16 = operation (again, 5 items)

17 factor model [no]
factor1 = speaking (6 items)
factor2 = perception (10 items) 
factor3 = arts & humanities (6 items)
factor4 = business (7 items)
factor5 = operation (10 items)
factor6 = building (9 items)
factor7 = health science (7 items)
factor8 = ??? (2 items) *incoherent factor, not enough items
factor9 = mathematics (5 items)
factor10 = management (5 items)
factor11 = dexterity (6 items)
factor12 = technical / mechanical skills (5 items)
factor13 = technological / systems skills (8 items)
factor14 = physical competencies (10 items)
factor15 = intelligence (13 items) *odd item = near vision (for reading)
factor16 = rhetoric (4 items)
factor17 = instructing (7 items)

sample-weighted efa: equamax rotation with competencies, work context, and work activities (217 items)

10 factor model [no]: medicine + philosophy
11 factor model [no]: medicine + philosophy
12 factor model [no]: medicine + philosophy
13 factor model [no]: medicine + philosophy
14 factor model [no]: medicine + philosophy
P.S.: 20+ factor models are too granular. And even with these complex factor structures, many troublesome items (near vision, foreign language, etc) still cluster on the "wrong" factors (in terms of interpretability). It is probably more adequate to  simply remove such items and rerun the smaller factor structures.

15 factor model [minimum to separate medicine and philosophy]
factor1 = intelligence (16 items) *odd item = near vision (for reading) 
factor2 = technical / mechanical skills (19 items) *somewhat underdifferentiated
factor3 = health science (15 items) *odd items = foreing language, time sharing
factor4 = operation (20 items) *somewhat underdifferentiated
factor5 = management (16 items)
factor6 = social skills (14 items) *odd item = importance of repeating the same tasks
factor7 = analytical skills (18 items) *odd item = interpersonal relationships (high crossloading with factor6)
factor8 = business (9 items) *mostly marketing (economics is odd in this factor)
factor9 = industrial (10 items)
factor10 = physical prowess (11 items) *odd item = food production
factor11 = building (15 items)
factor12 = discernment (21 items) *somewhat odd items
factor13 = arts & humanities (12 items)
factor14 = administrative (11 items) *odd items = programming, computers & electronics
factor15 = physical exertion / job hazards (10 items)

16 factor model
factor1 = intelligence (14 items) *programming finally clusters here 
factor2 = perception / dexterity / operation (15 items) *somewhat underdifferentiated
factor3 = health science (13 items) *odd item = foreing language (time sharing no longer clusters here)
factor4 = operation (17 items)
factor5 = management (15 items)
factor6 = office / social skills (16 items) *odd item = importance of repeating the same tasks
factor7 = analytical skills (18 items) *odd item = interpersonal relationships (high crossloading with factor6)
factor8 = business (9 items) *mostly marketing (economics is odd in this factor)
factor9 = industrial (6 items)
factor10 = administrative (8 items) *odd item = computers & electronics
factor11 = building (15 items)
factor12 = makes no sense (10 items) *really odd items
factor13 = arts & humanities (12 items)
factor14 = mechanical skills / dexterity (15 items)
factor15 = physical prowess (19 items)
factor16 = mathematics (15 items) *odd item = near vision (for reading)
