# `compare` module
Comparative models cannot be estimated with a single skill set, but require at least two skill sets.

## pairwise
Binary models that are calculated by comparing two skill sets
- Similarity (`match` submodule)
- Qualification
- Interchangeability (sufficient similarity)
- Productivity (`prod` submodule)
- Education and Experience Equivalence
- Hireability
- Employability
- Utility Optimization

## aggregate
Models that aggregate multiple pairwise models into a single value
- Aggregate employability
- Labor market competitiveness

## macroeconomic
These models mobilize previous concepts into higher-level abstractions
- Economic Taxonomy
- Dynamic Labor Markets
