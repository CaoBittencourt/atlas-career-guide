# `compare` submodule
Comparative models cannot be estimated with a single skill set, but require at least two skill sets.

- Pairwise: binary models that are calculated by comparing two skill sets
    - Similarity
    - Qualification
    - Interchangeability (sufficient similarity)
    - Productivity
    - Education and Experience Equivalence
    - Hireability
    - Employability
    - Utility Optimization
- Aggregate: models that aggregate multiple pairwise models into a single value
    - Aggregate employability
    - Labor market competitiveness
- Macroeconomic: these models mobilize previous concepts into higher-level abstractions
    - Economic Taxonomy
    - Dynamic Labor Markets
