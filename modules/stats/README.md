# stats submodule
This module contains coefficients that can be calculated using a single skill set. They do not require comparison with any other metrics and can, therefore, be thought of as properties of a skill set. 

They are:
- Generality: a skill set's generality determines whether one is a generalist or specialist.
- Competence: a skill set's competence describes the magnitude of one's overall skill level.
- Equivalence: attribute equivalence is calculated for each attribute within a skill set.
