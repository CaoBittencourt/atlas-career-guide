# Introduction

## Intelligence Quotient (IQ)

[What IQ is]

[Why IQ is important]

## Motivation

[Despite the importance of IQ, it is illegal in the US to select job applicants based on IQ scores]

[Therefore, an alternative NOT IQ metric, which yields similar results would be very much useful]

# An Alternative to IQ Tests

## The NOT IQ Metric

[introduction to NOT IQ]

### Proxies for IQ

[Explain Factor Analysis of BLS-ONET data]

[Proxies for IQ = Discernment and Intelligence]

### NOT IQ Formula

$$
\tilde{g} = \overline{g} + \sigma_g \left( \frac{\psi_g - \overline{\Psi}_g}{\sigma_{\Psi_g}} \right)
$$

[explain variables]

[Using $\Psi_g$ = Discernment and Intelligence factors, with the usual mean IQ of 100 with standard deviation of 15]

$$
\tilde{g} = 100 + 15 \times \left( \frac{\psi_g - 41.1}{14.8} \right)
$$

# Results

## Distribution of NOT IQ

[The NOT IQ Bell Curve]

## Model Precision

### Benchmarks

[IQ of occupations]

### Overall Precision

[Calculate weighted mean of error and percent error]

[Most and least precise estimations]

[Distribution of errors]

## Most and Least Intelligent Occupations

[Ridge plot of most and least intelligent occupations]

## Impact of NOT IQ on Wages

[regression model]
