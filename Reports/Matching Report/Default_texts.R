chr_text.intro <- "Hello, ___! Welcome to your professional matching report! In this document, you'll find solidly researched information on your compatibility with ___ different career paths.
\nOur state-of-the-art psychometric models and questionnaires were developed using publicly available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Occupational Information Network (ONET). This database consists in a set of 161 job characteristics, such as entry level of education, required skills, abilities and other competencies (rated from 0 to 1), as well as typical job activities, job hazards, and so on.
\nOne of our goals at Atlas ResearchÂ® is to determine the career that best fits your professional profile. Therefore, we assess your most important competencies and job preferences, and compare these with the ___ occupations we've gathered from the BLS and ONET. Then, we arrange your professional matches best to worst and estimate a compatibility score as a percentage, indicating your similarity to each occupation.

chr_text.compatibility.curve <- "In the figure above, you can see your professional compatibility curve. 
This plot features, on the horizontal axis, your career matches ranked lowest to highest based on your professional compatibility score (on the vertical axis).
Your best match is '___', with ___% compatibility; and the worst is '___', with ___%.
The median match is '___', with ___% compatibility, below which lies 50% of careers.
Thus, it is evident that your range of recommended occupations is ___, covering ___ of our ___-occupations database.
\nThe slope of the curve indicates how spread apart is your professional profile. 
If the curve if flat, then all values are identical.
And as the angle increases to 45 degrees, each observation becomes entirely unique.
Statiscally, we can assess how dispersed is the compatibility curve by calculating the variance of your compatibility scores.
In addition, the skewness of the curve tells us if your profile is more restricted to a few niche occupations or if it is less defined.
By doing these calculations, we find you have ___ matching percentages across all occupations.
This means ___.
